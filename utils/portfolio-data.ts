department. The attention to detail and ability to make precise measurements in
frames are critical for both aesthetic and conservation reasons, and it could be
beneficial to have a person in the carpenter position that has the ability to assist
Sam and Sarah if needed in urgent framing projects.</p>`,

Before this chamber, new Marvelseal envelopes had to be created every time before each treatment and were typically disposed of afterwards.
Being able to create a resource like this for Mia was an incredibly rewarding project.</p>`,

Crew to coordinate next steps and assisted with the reinstallation. This was an extremely rewarding project, and it's what I'm
hoping to move towards in my next chapter of museum work.</p>`,

a little off. When done correctly though, it has a precise look that is clean and professional. I
feel the attention to detail and skills needed for inset door construction directly relates to the
way vitrines fit into pedestals. I also think there’s an opportunity to incorporate the inset door
concept into Mia’s microclimate pedestals to give the “gel access door” a cleaner look.</p>`},

				description: `<p>For the door hinge to function correctly, it can’t be directly against the wall (the hinge opens
greater than 90 ̊). It seemed preferable though to have the hinge on the right so the cabinet
opens “to the room” vs “to the wall”. Bumping the hinge out from the wall created about 8” of
wasted space. To make productive use of this space, I incorporated a wine rack into the design.
The space was divided into five equal parts with the bottle stabilized directly in the center.</p>`

		description: `<p>This picture is from a home remodel project I designed and completed. Before the project
started, the gray wall was solid- nothing open between the spaces. I wanted to open it up, but
unfortunately this turned out to be a load bearing wall and I wasn’t prepared to start making
structural changes to the house.</p>
<p>After thinking more about the project, a solution was developed where tapered columns were
built around the structural 2x4 framing. This solution did not alter anything structural in the
wall and developed an openness connecting the spaces.</p>
<p>I feel this project is a good example that shows general woodworking skills, but also
demonstrates an ability to think creatively and make decisions that deal with unexpected issues
that may come up in projects.</p>`,
